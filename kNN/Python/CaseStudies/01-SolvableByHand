Using kNN algorithm find the category of the movie denoted by "?"

SNo.  MovieTitle                   # of kicks          # of kisses           Genre
1     California Man                    3                   104           Romance

5.    Robo slayer 3000                 99                     5           Action
6.    Amped II                         98                     2           Action
7.    ?                                18                    90           UNKNOWN

SOLUTION
--------

Using Euclidean Distance calculated as

d = SQRT((xA0 - xB0)^2 + (xA1-xB1)^2

where xA0 and xA1 are both the points whose class/label needs to be determined.
and xB0 and XB2 are the actual points in the training dataset.

Assuming SNo refers to the movies, we will use d+ i(where i = serialno) to refer to distance between the ith movie and the unknown 
movie (SNo.7) 
eg., d1 refers to the distancce between the movie California Man and the unknown movie and d6 refers to distance between Amped II and
the unknown movie. 

Then

when i = 1
d1 = distance between (3,104) and (18,90)

Substituting in the euclidean distance formula

d1 = SquareRoot of [(3-18)^2 + (90-104)^2]
   = SquareRoot of [(-15)^2 + (-14)^2]
   = SquareRoot of [225 + 196]
   = SquareRoot of [421]
d1 = 20.52

Calculating in the similar fashion from d2 through d7 we get

when i = 2
d2 = distance between (2,100) and (18,90)
and by euclidean distance formula
d2 = 18.87

when i = 3
d3 = distance between (1,81) and (18,90)
d3 = 19.24

when i = 4
d4 = 115.3

when i = 5
d5 = 117.4

when i = 6
d6 = 118.93

Now that we have the distance lets arrange the movies in the original order along with their distance from the unknown Movie


SNo.  MovieTitle                   # of kicks          # of kisses        Genre       Distance from the unknown movie
1     California Man                    3                   104           Romance      20.52
2     He's not really into dudes        2                   100           Romance      18.87
3.    Beautiful woman                   1                    91           Romance      19.24
4.    Kevin Longblade                 101                    10           Action      115.30
5.    Robo slayer 3000                 99                     5           Action      117.40
6.    Amped II                         98                     2           Action      118.93

Arranging the list in the order of increasing distance from the unknown movie, it would be

SNo.  MovieTitle                   # of kicks          # of kisses        Genre       Distance from the unknown movie
2     He's not really into dudes        2                   100           Romance      18.87
3.    Beautiful woman                   1                    91           Romance      19.24
1     California Man                    3                   104           Romance      20.52
4.    Kevin Longblade                 101                    10           Action      115.30
5.    Robo slayer 3000                 99                     5           Action      117.40
6.    Amped II                         98                     2           Action      118.93

If we decide to have K as 4, then the top 4 movies closer to the unknown movie are

SNo.  MovieTitle                   # of kicks          # of kisses        Genre       Distance from the unknown movie
2     He's not really into dudes        2                   100           Romance      18.87
3.    Beautiful woman                   1                    91           Romance      19.24
1     California Man                    3                   104           Romance      20.52
4.    Kevin Longblade                 101                    10           Action      115.30

The goal is to find the genre of the unknown movie. In the above list we find that the top 4 picks have 2 genres namely Romance
and Action with Romance garnering 3 votes and Action garnering 1. So the majority of the classes/labels that surround the unknown movie is
"Romance" and hence the unkonwn movie should fall into the "Romance" category.
